DESCRIPTION
===========

  "spell_extractfs.exe" extracts Spellcross *.fs archive into "data\" subfolder. It also creates *.lst file with list of extracted files.
  
  This utility was developed in BDS2006 Turbo C++ and tested only on M$ Windows XP so I have no idea how this SW will or will not work on newer or older OS versions. 


USAGE
=====

spell_extractfs.exe source [-lh]

source:
 - "*.FS" archive path

-lh (optional):
 - print long header



*.LST FORMAT
============

Line 0:      "files: N", where N is count of files
Line 1 to N: absolute paths
